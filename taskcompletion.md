# Task Completion Log

## Concept Activation Network MCP Server Implementation

### âœ… Core Implementation
- [x] Created project structure in `/tmp/can-mcp-server/`
- [x] Implemented main server entry point (`can-server.js`)
- [x] Implemented session manager (`session-manager.js`)
- [x] Implemented concept network core (`concept-network.js`)
- [x] Implemented MCP tools interface (`mcp-tools.js`)
- [x] Created package.json with dependencies
- [x] Created comprehensive README.md
- [x] Created build verification script (`build_all.sh`)

### âœ… Key Features Implemented
- [x] Parallel activation spreading algorithm
- [x] Concept node and connection management
- [x] Configurable activation parameters
- [x] Emergent pattern detection
- [x] Activation history tracking
- [x] MCP interface for AI interaction

### âœ… Verification Steps
- [x] Generated all required files
- [x] Added comprehensive documentation
- [x] Created build verification script
- [x] Ran build verification script (syntax check passed)

### ðŸ“‹ Next Steps
- [ ] Add unit tests
- [ ] Implement visualization tools
- [ ] Create example client implementation
- [ ] Add pre-built concept networks for common domains
- [ ] Optimize performance for large networks

The Concept Activation Network MCP Server has been successfully implemented and is ready for initial testing. The server provides a complete alternative thinking framework that enables AI systems to use parallel, associative thinking instead of sequential reasoning.

## Build Verification Results
- Syntax check for all JavaScript files: PASSED
- File structure verification: PASSED
- Dependencies: Need to install when deployed in a real environment
